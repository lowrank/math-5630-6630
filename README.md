# INTRODUCTION TO NUMERICAL ANALYSIS I (5630/6630)

This repository contains the material for the course "Introduction to Numerical Analysis I" taught at Auburn University. The course serves as an introduction to numerical analysis and computing for undergraduate/graduate students in mathematics, science, and engineering. The course covers the following topics:

- Floating point arithmetic
- Root finding
- Interpolation
- Numerical integration
- Numerical differentiation
- Ordinary differential equations

## Programming Languages

The supported programming language in this course are Python and MATLAB. You can use either one of them to complete the programming assignments. If you are not familiar with Python, you can find a quick tutorial [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). If you are not familiar with MATLAB, you can find a quick tutorial [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html).

## Submission Guidelines

The written part of homework assignments are submitted via Canvas. You can either scan the written solutions into PDF files or typeset your solutions in Word or LATEX, then convert/compile into PDF files.

The programming part of homework assignments should be submitted separately to Canvas. To submit your work, follow the instructions in each homework and you have to make sure your code has passed all the preliminary tests.

- For MATLAB users, run the command under the same directory of the homework in MATLAB to check your code:

```matlab
hw_test
```

- For Python users, run the command under the same directory of the homework in terminal to check your code:

```bash
python hw_test.py
```

After passing the tests, you can submit your work either by

- pushing your code to your GitHub repository and submit the public link of the repository to Canvas.
- creating a zip file of your code and submit it to Canvas.

The programming part of homework assignments will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: your code should pass all the preliminary tests.
- Implementation: your code will be tested against different inputs and the running time will be recorded. If your code is not efficient enough, you will possibly lose points.
